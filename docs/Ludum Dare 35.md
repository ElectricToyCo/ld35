Ludum Dare 35
=============

Theme: Shapeshift

Strengths of the theme:
	Shape
	change
	doppelganger
	metamorphosis
	transition
	shape in the geometric sense
	shape - animal form
	shape - clay, molding
	shape - life, time of life
	shift - the keyboard key
	shift - change
	shift - drift
	shift - adjustment

Directions:
	Abstract, geometric
	sci-fi/fantasy, doppelganger
	Shape a shift key
	shape as a verb: shape a "shift" (noun?)
	Shape in geometric but looser forms: 
		military command (parade)
		body shape
		clay
	soft body dynamics

Grabbing coffee (8:54PM)
Back from coffee (9:06PM). Who thought of this stupid theme?

* Asteroid racer/chaser
* Luftrausers-style game with cloud obscurations
* Soft body/inflation platformer

What about more story based?
        ...more text based?

    Convince a disliking character to like a topic by getting a character they like to talk to them
    Convince a liking character to like another character by getting them to talk about something they both like
    Use shapeshifting to become a character that can do what you can't do otherwise
    Use more than one character to influence a character doubly
    ... and so on with greater levels of indirection (i.e. influence a character to influence a character to influence the target character, through more than one channel, sometimes foiled by an antithesis character or characters)
