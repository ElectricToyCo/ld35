Ludum Dare 35
=============

Theme: Shapeshift

Strengths of the theme:
	Shape
	change
	doppelganger
	metamorphosis
	transition
	shape in the geometric sense
	shape - animal form
	shape - clay, molding
	shape - life, time of life
	shift - the keyboard key
	shift - change
	shift - drift
	shift - adjustment

Directions:
	Abstract, geometric
	sci-fi/fantasy, doppelganger
	Shape a shift key
	shape as a verb: shape a "shift" (noun?)
	Shape in geometric but looser forms: 
		military command (parade)
		body shape
		clay
	soft body dynamics

Grabbing coffee (8:54PM)
Back from coffee (9:06PM). Who thought of this stupid theme?

* Asteroid racer/chaser
* Luftrausers-style game with cloud obscurations

What about more story based?
        ...more text based?

# Tutorial Sequence

## Intro Text

IntroText "Your name is EMMA. You're a not-particularly popular girl at a not-particularly interesting school. But you have a little secret: you're a SHAPESHIFTER. You can take on the form of your fellow students.\n\nAnd this is handy, because all they ever do is talk, talk, talk about what they LOVE and what they HATE. Sometimes they LOVE the wrong things; sometimes they HATE the wrong things. But by SHAPESHIFTING, you can join in the conversation and CHANGE THEIR MINDS.\n\nInfluencing people to see things (and each other!) the way YOU want them to see them: THAT is your special gift."

TutorialPlayerCharacter "This is Emma. Use WASD to move."

TutorialInspection "This is Tiffany. Get close to her and hit SPACE to see what she's thinking."
